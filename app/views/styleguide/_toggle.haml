%p.sg-p This project implements a generic toggling system to show and hide content. The trigger should have the attribute <span class="sg-code">data-toggle="#foo-target"</span>. The target does not need any special attributes or classes. The target's <span class="sg-code">max-height</span> needs to be set to 0 and <span class="sg-code">overflow</span> to hidden, in order to see/enable the toggling transition.
