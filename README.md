#Styleguide Framework
===

This framework is meant to be a jumping off point for creating future styleguides for future web projects. Ideally, the project's designer/front-end dev should create a styleguide similar to this before starting the development of the site's individual pages. Having this styleguide built before starting the actual site development will ensure all parties involved in the project will have a single page they can consult to get a very clear overview of the project from a dev/design perspective.

##Setup
---

This framework is based on Middleman as it offers a number of advantages (SASS/Haml, Ruby, Partials, etc.). To get started, you'll first want to install Middleman on your machine if you haven't already done so. For <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/">full installation instructions</a> visit the Middleman install page. A basic run-through of the Middleman install process is as follows:

1. Create a free Apple Developer account
1. Download and install Command Line Tools
1. Download styleguide
1. gem install middleman
1. cd to styleguide
1. Start middleman server
