#Styleguide Framework
===

This framework is meant to be a jumping off point for creating future styleguides for future web projects. Ideally, the project's designer/front-end dev should create a styleguide similar to this before starting the development of the site's individual pages. Having this styleguide built before starting the actual site development will ensure all parties involved in the project will have a single page they can consult to get a very clear overview of the project from a dev/design perspective.

##Setup
---

This framework is based on Ruby on Rails as it offers a number of advantages (SASS/Haml, Partials, etc.). To get started, you'll first want to install Rails on your machine if you haven't already done so.
