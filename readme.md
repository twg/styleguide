#TWG Styleguide

##What is a styleguide?

Front-end frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) are awesome. The most awesome feature of these frameworks is not their plethora of shiny components but instead their thorough documentation. Having extensive front-end documentation helps prevent developers from writing redundant code, makes it easier to on-board new developers to a project, and ensures better communication between front-end and back-end developers.

A styleguide is a page or series of pages that house project documentation. For example, [Mailchimp](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/), [Lonely Planet](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/colours), and [SalesForce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) all have thorough and useful styleguides publicly available.

##What is TWG Styleguide

TWG Styleguide is a single CSS file that contains a generic and reusable styleguide theme. Since TWG Styleguide is simply a CSS file it makes no assumptions about your project's tech-stack, this means that you should easily be able to integrate the TWG Styleguide into any project. You can see an [example implementation](http://twg.github.io/styleguide/) of TWG Styleguide here.
